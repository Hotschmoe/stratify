# Generic LVL (Laminated Veneer Lumber) Design Values
#
# Source: Representative values from industry specifications
# Note: For actual design, use manufacturer-specific values with ICC-ES report
#
# DEPTH ADJUSTMENT:
# For depths > 12": Fb_adjusted = Fb * (12/d)^exponent
# Standard exponent for LVL is 0.111 (1/9)
