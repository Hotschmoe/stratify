# NDS 2018 Supplement Table 4A - Reference Design Values for Visually Graded Dimension Lumber
#
# Source: NDS Supplement: Design Values for Wood Construction, 2018 Edition
# Table: 4A
# Scope: Dimension lumber (2" to 4" thick), values for 2x10 and wider
#
# NOTES:
# - All stress values are in psi (pounds per square inch)
# - E and Emin are in psi (not ksi or million psi)
# - Only SS, No1, No2, No3 grades stored here
# - Stud, Construction, Standard, Utility are derived in code from base grades
# - Apply appropriate adjustment factors per NDS Chapter 4
