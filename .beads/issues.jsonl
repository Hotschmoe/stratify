Consistency Review\n- [ ] Standardize property naming across all materials (e.g., `fb_psi` vs `Fb`)\n- [ ] Ensure all materials have `display_name()`, `from_str_flexible()` patterns\n- [ ] Review error handling consistency\n- [ ] Add `ALL` const arrays for UI iteration where missing\n\n### 2. Data Verification System\n- [ ] Create checksums/hashes for built-in data\n- [ ] Add version tracking for each data source (NDS 2018, AISC v16.0, etc.)\n- [ ] Document data provenance in module headers\n- [ ] Consider unit test that verifies sample values against published tables\n\n### 3. Future-Proofing\n- [ ] Design pattern for CSV-based materials (like steel) vs hard-coded (like wood)\n- [ ] Consider build.rs for compiling CSV data into static structures\n- [ ] Add metadata struct for each library: source, version, last_verified_date\n\n### 4. Documentation\n- [ ] Create OBTAINING_*.md files for NDS lumber data (similar to AISC)\n- [ ] Document how to verify data is current\n- [ ] Add references to specific table/page numbers in codes\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- All material modules follow consistent patterns\n- Each data source has documented provenance\n- Verification tests exist for spot-checking official values\n- Clear instructions for updating when new code editions release","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-19T11:13:03.8724517-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-19T11:13:03.8724517-07:00"}
